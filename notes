(*) Singleton: a design pattern that ensures that only one instance of a class, that can be instanciated
in the entire application. to implement this in c++, all the constructors shall be private
to ensure that the class cannot be instanciated outside of its declaration or definition.
then declare a function with a static variable (static Class object;) that returns always the same static object.
Go to learn.cpp file to find a very easy example.
